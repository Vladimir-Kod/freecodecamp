/*
Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:
To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a newline.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine
*/

const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line
