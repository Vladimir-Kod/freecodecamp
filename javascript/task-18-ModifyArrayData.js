Modify Array Data With Indexes
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, 
even if the array was declared with const.

Waiting:You should be using correct index to modify the value in myArray.

// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line
myArray[0]=45;
